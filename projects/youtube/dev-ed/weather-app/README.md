# Weather App
A simple weather app I learned to build alongside Dev Ed in his [Build A Weather App With Vanilla Javascript Tutorial | Javascript For Beginners Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPElVpR1rwA). Credit goes to Ed for the build/design of this site. I just changed the colours and used Montserrat from Google Fonts for overall font family.

### Things I learned building this project
- Further practice with arrow functions
- Obtaining user's location using navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition
- First time using an API, and customizing the API key to include our lat and long variables
- Using a proxy to allow requests on Local Host
- How to modify data retreived from the API
- How to load in animated icons/use HTML Canvas element
