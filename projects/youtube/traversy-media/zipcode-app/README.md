# PROJECT TITLE HERE

This project was build alongside Brad Traversy in his [JavaScript Zipcode App Using Fetch & Bulma CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3GfUH7AZKs&list=PLillGF-RfqbbnEGy3ROiLWk7JMCuSyQtX&index=25) YouTube video.

### What I learned making this project:
- First time using the [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) CSS framework 
- First time using the [Zippopotam.us API](https://zippopotam.us/)

### What I was able to do on my own
- Convert the function shown by Brad into an async/await function
