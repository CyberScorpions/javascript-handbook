# Reddit Search App

This project was build alongside Brad Traversy in his [Build a Reddit Search App With ES6, Fetch & Parcel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VITzIZB-bXU&list=PLillGF-RfqbbnEGy3ROiLWk7JMCuSyQtX&index=32) YouTube video.

### What I learned making this project:
- Using the Reddit API
- Further practice using `fetch`, and `.then()` + `.catch()`
