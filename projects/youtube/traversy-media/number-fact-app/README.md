# Vanilla JS Number Facts App Using Fetch

This project was built alongside Brad Traversy in his [Vanilla JS Number Facts App - Ajax & Fetch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUE2Nic21BA&list=PLillGF-RfqbbnEGy3ROiLWk7JMCuSyQtX&index=22) YouTube video.

### Things I learned while making this project
- Using fetch() to grab data from an API
- Injected the fetched data into a paragraph

### Things I was able to do on my own
- Dynamically change which API the data is being fetched from based on selected option
- Set display back to none for number-facts paragraph for if the input field is blank
- Added basic validation
  - If the selected option was not "Choose..." then proceed
  - Alert the user if the number input was blank and if the selected option was still "Choose..."
