# Full Screen Responsive Image Slider

This project was build alongside Brad Traversy in his [Full Screen Responsive Image Slider | No Libraries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWWNrANNO1k&list=PLillGF-RfqbbnEGy3ROiLWk7JMCuSyQtX&index=21) YouTube video.

### What I learned making this project:
- First time using the range input type
  - Setting custom min/max values for the input as well
- Using the Speech Synthesis API
- Further practice with:
  - forEach loops
  - arrow functions
  - template literals
