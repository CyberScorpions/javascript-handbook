// ----------------------------------- LET & CONST -----------------------------------
// let and const are the new ways of declaring variables
const player = 'Bobby'; // const stands for constant
let experience = 100;
let wizardLevel = false;

if (experience > 90) {
	let wizardLevel = true;
	console.log(wizardLevel); // true

	// *NOTE* 
	// Without this console.log line, it would be false
	// it would be false because it is not inside of a function
	// We've created a 'wizardLevel' variable inside of 'if' so the only way that we can access this is inside the 'if'.
	// So, with 'let', any time it's wrapped around a curly bracket, it creates a new scope, versus with var, where both would be true
}

console.log(wizardLevel); // false

// ----------------------------------- NOTE -----------------------------------
// With const, you're not able to reassign to the variable. So it cannot be updated.
// Now, why would that be useful?
// It's really, really useful because a lot of bugs happen when you're working in a team of people.
// The recommendation is that if you have anything that isn't going to change, it should be a constant.

// Const example
const obj = {
	player: 'Jack',
	xpPoints: 100,
	isWizardLevel: false
}
// With this example, you cannot do something like const obj = 5;
// But what you CAN DO, is reassign the values inside the object
// Such as obj.isWizardLevel = true;
// This rule also applies to arrays
