// There are 3 ways to set variables in JavaScript: var, let, & const
// var is outdated, and not really recommended
// Always use const unless you know you'll be reassigning that value
// Makes your code more robust/secure, and less prone to errors

// var variable
var firstName = 'Timmy';

// let variable
let myAge = 30;

// const variable
const lastName = 'John';
